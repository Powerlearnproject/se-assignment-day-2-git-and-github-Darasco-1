## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that will help to track changes made to files over time. Funddamental concepts are :
commit: a commit means saving a version of your . it incudes all the changes that was made since the last commit. 
Merge: this is when the various versions of a codebase is combined into the codebase itself(main). An analogy is, when working on an important software, you need to make changes to the project but you dont want it to disturb the original codebase yet, a branch can be created which will be merged into the main when the changes are complited.
repository: this is a storage or a folder where the project being worked on is kept. it can be stores locally on personal PC or remotely on a server
Cloning: this is basically copying a file from a remote repository to a local repository on a personal PC. It means what you have in cloud storage is now also on the laptop.
Pull: ths is the command witten in git bash that is used to download content from a remote repository and update local repository to create a match.
GitHub is popular because it is a open source program, that is its free for all.It is built on top of git which is the most widely used and distributed version control. It is efficient and flexible and has powerful merging abilities. It also a community of dvelopers that has a global reach. these reasons are why its popular.
Version control help project integrity because, it help collaborators to see and track changes made to a file or project. It creates a transparent platform where every collaborator will see who and what has been done.it ensures that all changes to a project are tracked, organized, and managed in a way that preserves the consistency and reliability of the codebase  
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Open a browser and type in github, then navigate to github and create an account. Then at the right, where there is top repositories, click new.
Give the repository a suitable name under the Repository name input box
Give a description (optional)
Then choose private or public. If you want to be the only one to view, choose private, but if you want others to see choose public.
Add a readme file.
you can choose license , then create repository

Important Decisions to be made are:
to choose public or private beacuse it will determine you can acess the file
the name to be given
## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
A readme file contain a description for a project. It tells anyone acessing the project what the project is all about. It is the most important 
## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
